Reflexive pseudopassive and passive:
    Naveliko            se    [je]    riba      juƒçer     jela
  ((In-large-quantities REFL) [AUX]) (fish-NOM (yesterday eaten))
  Fish was eaten in large quantities yesterday.

  REFL transform the verb's COMPS list, just like passivization:
    [EATER(nom), EATEN(acc)]
      becomes
    [            EATEN(nom)]

  While passivization can be treated as a lexical transformation at the
  point of recognising passive participle morphology, pseudopassivized
  verb has active morphology, and is only transformed when put together
  with the REFL.  However, in this scenario, "riba" (fish-NOM) cannot be
  recognised, since at the time of binding of "fish" and "yesterday
  eaten", the information from REFL is not yet available.

  Alternately, allow the fish to be bound to the nominative slot? On
  pure syntax level, deleting a non-nominative slot would then suffice -
  But how to expunge its index from the verb's meaning when REFL is
  finally seen?
