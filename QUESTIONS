REFL-acc

  Reflexive pseudopassive

        Naveliko            se    [je]    riba      jučer     jela
      ((In-large-quantities REFL) [AUX]) (fish-NOM (yesterday eaten))
      Fish was eaten in large quantities yesterday.

    REFL transform the verb's COMPS list, just like passivization:

      [EATER(nom), EATEN(acc)]
        becomes
      [            EATEN(nom)]

    While passivization can be treated as a lexical transformation at
    the point of recognising passive participle morphology,
    pseudopassivized verb has active morphology, and is only transformed
    when put together with the REFL.  However, in this scenario, "riba"
    (fish-NOM) cannot be recognised, since at the time of binding of
    "fish" and "yesterday eaten", the information from REFL is not yet
    available.

    Alternately, allow the fish to be bound to the nominative slot? On
    pure syntax level, deleting a non-nominative slot would then suffice
    - But how to expunge its index from the verb's meaning when REFL is
    finally seen?

    Or - generate all verbs in both ways, just in case? One of them must
    be bound to pseudopassive REFL, the other can't. This might be the
    best option, but it does double processing time for each active
    verb.

  Desiderative REFL causes a similar transformation:

      [EATER(dat), EATEN(nom)]

    However, the dative is also otherwise always an option, in the
    benefactive/possessive meaning, and thus does not cause the problems
    above.  However, the problem of connecting the correct
    (desiderative) meaning where it is intended still remains. Also, the
    desiderative reflexive abolishes the nominative subject.

      a) Jede se žgance
      b) Jedu mi se žganci

  Reciprocal REFL does too

    It modifies the meaning of the verb, and deletes the accusative
    slot.

  Lexically required REFL and true reflexive

    They do not require special considerations. Lexically required verbs
    will carry an appropriate REFL feature that needs to be satisfied by
    binding with a REFL. True reflexives will just bind with a REFL as
    an argument.


RECIPROCAL

    Ivan(nom) i Ivana(nom) udaraju jedan(nom) drugoga(acc)
    Ivan(nom) i Ivana(nom) rukuju se jedan(nom) s drugim(ins)
    Upoznajem Ivana(acc) i Ivanu(acc) jednog(acc) s drugim(ins)

    John and Joanna hit each other
    John and Joanna shake-hands each with other
    I introduce John and Joanna each with other

  The reciprocal position will be filled with "drugi" in its proper
  case, and immediately before that constituent, "jedan" will be
  inserted, with case corresponding to the antecedent's. Gender and
  number will be the same for "jedan" and "drugi": gender corresponds to
  the general rule for collections in Croatian (masculine if mixed);
  number is pragmatically determined (can be both singular and plural,
  depending on whether the antecedent can form subgroups or not), and
  thus outside the scope of syntax.


LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES

  In cases where COMPS arguments are missing, they can be put into the
  STORE at the top of the clause, if there is exactly one COMPS missing.
  For example:

    a) Vidim djevojku koja jede jabuku
       I-see girl     who  eats apple
  
  "jede jabuku" has noun-nom still in COMPS. It can be transfered to
  INHER\REL, which will be bound to "koja". "koja" is CASE\nom, MOD\noun
  and TO_BIND\REL\(noun & CASE\nom).

    b) Vidim jabuku koju djevojka jede
       I-see apple  who  girl     eats

  Same; "koju" is CASE\acc, MOD\noun, TO_BIND\REL\(noun & CASE\acc)

    c) Vidim djevojku čiju  jabuku jedem
       I-see girl     whose apple  I-eat

  "čiju" (whose) is MOD\[noun & CASE\acc], CASE\acc, TO_BIND\REL\(noun &
  CASE\acc). TO_BIND is inherited from either HEAD or non-HEAD, so "čiju
  jabuku" gets bound by HEAD-MOD schema, still having TO_BIND - and then
  that binds the trace.

    d) Vidim jabuku koju  mi    djevojka jede
       I-see apple  which to-me girl     eats

  Same as d). "mi" clitic does not have a COMPS entry, so it is bound as
  a modifier. TODO: how does the possessive/benefactive meaning enter
  here?

    e) Vidim djevojku s    kojom jedem jabuke
       I-see girl     with who   I-eat apples

  "s" (with) is COMPS\(noun & CASE\ins). "kojom" is CASE\ins,
  TO_BIND\REL\(noun & CASE\ins), MOD\noun. "s kojom" is bound by
  HEAD-COMP schema, and "s kojom" thus has TO_BIND\REL\(noun & CASE\ins)
  and MOD\noun (both of which would have to be inherited from "kojom").

    f) Koga vidim da   jede jabuku?
       Whom I-see that eats apple?

  "koga" (whom) binds the noun-animate trace at the sentence top. TODO:
  How is the sentence top detected (also important for clitic attachment
  rules)

    g) Čiju  jabuku vidim da   jede?
       Whose apple  I-see that he-eats?

  Same as c), but with a question-variant of "čiju" instead of the
  relativizing one.

    h) Jabuku vidim da   jede.
       Apple  I-see that he-eats.

  "jabuku" is topicalized here; the trace generated at "jede" sentence
  top is bound at the overall "vidim da jede" sentence top.


PREPOSITIONS - MARKING-MARKED or HEAD-COMPLEMENT?

  Long Distance Dependencies example e), where most important
  information must be inherited from "kojom" (who), suggests "kojom" is
  a head, not "s" (with). Also, it would be more intuitive specifying
  verb complements (CASE\gen & MARKED\od, instead of PFORM\od_gen).
  
  On the other hand, how would non-complement prepositions contribute
  meaning, and become modifiers?


CONJUNCTIONS

  Intuitively, coordinating conjunctions are symmetrical. However, this
  approach might work: in A CONJ B, CONJ modifies A and complements for
  B. Except for semantics, again.
